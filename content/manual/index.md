This manual describes all the information that exceeds a simple note on [the homepage](/).
It contains professional and personal details, e.g., how I communicate, work, and socialize.

[And what about you?](https://manualof.me/)

## Culture & communication

[The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map) is one of the most exciting books I've read recently. A quick summary of my preferences based on that book will be listed below.

tl;dr, I match more or less with German culture.

I'm egalitarian, and I try to reflect that in my language. Hence, it will be very low-context to help anybody with a different background understand my message. I have no problem receiving a justified critique and am keen to openly discuss my strengths and weaknesses.

Mixing the low-context trait with my confrontational attitude may be received as rude, but I try to emphasize and adjust to my interlocutor. I strongly prefer to work out a consensus rather than impose my will or be imposed on one.

Regarding "theory vs. practice," I stand in the middle - one cannot exist with the other, and I prefer to know both. Same with time - it's good to be on schedule, but not everything should be scheduled.

## Personality type

        <header><h3>Assertive Logician</h3></header>
        <blockquote>Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can‚Äôt help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe ‚Äì which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren‚Äôt afraid to stand out from the crowd.</blockquote>

## Preferred working hours

Disclaimer 1: My hours depend on the season, e.g., in winter, I miss the sun so much (greetings from 51¬∞N) that I prefer to have a longer break around noon.

Disclaimer 2: My notion of "a season" is strictly European.

Disclaimer 3: Those are preferred, but I am flexible.

- ‚ùÑÔ∏è In the winter I work from Monday to Friday 10:00-12:00, 14:00-16:00, and continue in the evening (21:00 to max 01:00).
- üå± In the spring I work from Monday to Friday 10:00-16:00 and sometimes continue in the evening around 21:00.

## Cuisine

- I do not treat lunches as a feast - it's OK for me to eat alone or eat quickly and get back to work
- I've been vegetarian since 2022-08
- I'm not allergic to anything
